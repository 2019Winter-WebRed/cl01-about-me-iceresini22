<p>I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and volleyball. I have played basketball for eight years and volleyball for one year. I played volleyball and basketball for my school and I have played travel basketball for the Wilmington tigers for three years. My favorite color is pastel yellow. My favorite holliday is halloween because I enjoy seeing the costumes and I enjoy all the sweets. I am half Italian on my dad's side and and I am mostly Irish on my mom's side but she is a lot of other things. One of my favorite movies is <i>Love Simon.</i> One of the quotes I live by is,</p>
     <blockquote><b>"You are confined only by the walls you build yourself."</b></blockquote>
    <!--Contains information about my dream job and why-->
<p>I have always wanted to be a veterinarian becasuse I love animals. Then I discovered how much I like ocean animals more than common animals. Ever since I was little I have loved dolphins, they are my favorite animal. A couple of years ago, when I was in Disney, I got to swim with a dolphin named Kaylee. It was the coolest thing considering how much I love dolphins. Now I hope to become a marine biologist and study marine life. </p>
